# Khidmat Project: Ghazali Grammar School Website

This repository serves as a central codebase for our Khidmat Project affiliated with Habib University, which is a website for Ghazali Grammar School under the Naqshbandi Taleemi Trust, based in Karachi Pakistan.


## About Khidmat

Khidmat is a non-credit graduation requirement for all CS-major students. It is an attempt to engage our students with society and help them make some meaningful contributions using the (computer science) skills you have learned so far. You will be working with some external non-profit organizations on some social cause project that requires your CS skills. You have to work for at least 40 for Khidmat.
